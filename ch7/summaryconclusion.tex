\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

In conclusion, this research intends to achieve practical adversarial attacks against deep learning models. We have made some progress in distributed black-box attacks (\textbf{Adversarial Classification}) and real-time white-box attacks (\textbf{Adversarial Driving}, \textbf{Adversarial Detection}, and the \textbf{Man-in-the-Middle hardware attack}).

\section{Thesis Summary}

In the last year, we'll try to devise adversarial attacks against object tracking and investigate the effects of hardware acceleration on our attacks. Eventually, we hope we can understand various models through interpretation, and thus deploying deep learning models more securely in robotics.
